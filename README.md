# 💫 About Me:
 🌱I thrive at the intersection of technology, entrepreneurship, and community building. Currently, I manage Partnerships, Community, and Growth at ProjectX, where I collaborate with teams, partners, and creators to drive impactful initiatives.

Beyond that, I founded G. NOVA ARENA, a hybrid gaming and esports community that unites digital gamers and field athletes under one platform. From hosting online tournaments to organizing offline football, basketball, and cricket events, I’ve created a space where competition sparks skill development, teamwork, and meaningful connections.

What motivates me is building ecosystems—whether for startups, communities, or events—that enable people to grow and engage meaningfully. With hands-on experience across startup environments, event management, and partnership development, I bring adaptability, leadership, and execution to every project.

If you’re building something around tech, sports, gaming, or community-led growth, let’s connect.<br><br>
